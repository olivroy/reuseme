Title: Collections of Utility Functions to Work Across Projects
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person("Olivier", "Roy", , "olivierroy71@hotmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Allows you to browse current projects, rename files safely,
    add screenshots to project on Windows.  It is also my personal library
    and contains wrapper around common functions, from dplyr and readxl.
    It takes advantage of cli hyperlinks.  Finally, it provides a custom
    print method for tibbles, inspired by janitor, and readr.

# reuseme: Collections of Utility Functions to Work Across Projects

Allows you to browse current projects, rename files safely, add
screenshots to project on Windows. It is also my personal library and
contains wrapper around common functions, from dplyr and readxl. It
takes advantage of cli hyperlinks. Finally, it provides a custom print
method for tibbles, inspired by janitor, and readr.

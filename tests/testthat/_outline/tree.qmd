## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
# TODO: fix this in the code
```

You can add options to executable code like this

### A sub header

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

TODO: here's a todo in the text

# Back to header 1

## Dont skip me

##### header 5

TODO: testing section

## Another sub header

TODO: section test
